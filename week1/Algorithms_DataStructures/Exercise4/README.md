#### Time Complexity
- **Add Operation**: O(1) - Adding an employee to the end of the array is a constant time operation.
- **Search Operation**: O(n) - Searching for an employee involves iterating through the array, which in the worst case requires examining all elements.
- **Traverse Operation**: O(n) - Traversing the array involves iterating through all elements.
- **Delete Operation**: O(n) - Deleting an employee requires searching for the employee (O(n)) and shifting elements to fill the gap (O(n)), resulting in an overall complexity of O(n).

#### Limitations of Arrays
- **Fixed Size**: Arrays have a fixed size, which limits their flexibility. If the number of elements exceeds the initial capacity, a new larger array needs to be created, and elements need to be copied over, which is costly.
- **Insertion and Deletion**: Inserting or deleting elements (other than at the end) requires shifting elements, which can be inefficient.
- **Memory Wastage**: If the array is not fully utilized, memory is wasted.

#### When to Use Arrays
- **Fixed-Size Data**: When the number of elements is known in advance and does not change frequently.
- **Fast Access**: When fast access to elements is required using indices.
- **Simple Data**: When managing simple data without frequent insertions and deletions.

For dynamic data structures with frequent insertions and deletions, other data structures like linked lists, dynamic arrays (e.g., ArrayList in Java), or hash tables might be more suitable.
