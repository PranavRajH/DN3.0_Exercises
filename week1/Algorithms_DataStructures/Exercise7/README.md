#### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - The recursive function `predictFutureValue` makes a single recursive call for each year, resulting in a linear time complexity relative to the number of years.
  
#### Optimization to Avoid Excessive Computation

Recursive algorithms can be optimized using techniques such as memoization or iterative solutions to avoid excessive computation and reduce the risk of stack overflow for large input sizes.

#### Optimized Iterative Solution

An iterative approach can be used to achieve the same result without the overhead of recursive calls.
