#### Time Complexity

- **Linear Search**:
  - **Best Case**: O(1) – The product is found at the first position.
  - **Average Case**: O(n/2) – On average, the product is found in the middle of the array.
  - **Worst Case**: O(n) – The product is found at the last position or not at all.

- **Binary Search**:
  - **Best Case**: O(1) – The product is found at the middle position.
  - **Average Case**: O(log n) – The search space is halved with each step.
  - **Worst Case**: O(log n) – The product is not found, and the entire log n steps are executed.

#### Suitability for the Platform
- **Linear Search**: Simple to implement and requires no pre-processing (sorting). Suitable for small arrays or unsorted data.
- **Binary Search**: More efficient for large, sorted arrays. Requires an initial sort operation (O(n log n)), but subsequent searches are O(log n).

**Recommendation**:
- For large datasets where search performance is critical and the dataset can be maintained in sorted order, **binary search** is more suitable due to its logarithmic time complexity.
- For smaller datasets or unsorted data, **linear search** might be more appropriate due to its simplicity and no need for sorting.
