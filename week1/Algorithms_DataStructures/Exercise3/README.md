#### Time Complexity

- **Bubble Sort**:
  - **Best Case**: O(n) (when the list is already sorted)
  - **Average Case**: O(n^2)
  - **Worst Case**: O(n^2)

- **Quick Sort**:
  - **Best Case**: O(n log n)
  - **Average Case**: O(n log n)
  - **Worst Case**: O(n^2) (when the smallest or largest element is always chosen as the pivot)

#### Comparison and Suitability
- **Bubble Sort**: Simple to implement but inefficient for large datasets due to its quadratic time complexity. It's suitable for small datasets or nearly sorted data.
- **Quick Sort**: Generally more efficient with an average time complexity of O(n log n). Suitable for large datasets. Its performance can degrade to O(n^2) with poor pivot choices, but this can be mitigated with strategies like random pivot selection or the median-of-three method.

**Recommendation**: 
Quick Sort is generally preferred over Bubble Sort for sorting customer orders on an e-commerce platform due to its better average-case performance, which is crucial for handling large numbers of orders efficiently.
