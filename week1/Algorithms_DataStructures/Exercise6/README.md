#### Time Complexity

- **Linear Search**:
  - **Best Case**: O(1) (if the book is the first one)
  - **Average Case**: O(n)
  - **Worst Case**: O(n) (if the book is the last one or not present)

- **Binary Search**:
  - **Best Case**: O(1) (if the book is the middle one)
  - **Average Case**: O(log n)
  - **Worst Case**: O(log n) (if the book is not present)

#### When to Use Each Algorithm

- **Linear Search**:
  - **Use When**: 
    - The dataset is small.
    - The list is unsorted.
    - There are frequent insertions and deletions that would make keeping the list sorted impractical.
  - **Advantages**: Simple to implement, does not require sorted data.
  - **Disadvantages**: Inefficient for large datasets.

- **Binary Search**:
  - **Use When**: 
    - The dataset is large.
    - The list is sorted or can be kept sorted with minimal overhead.
  - **Advantages**: Much faster for large datasets due to its logarithmic time complexity.
  - **Disadvantages**: Requires the list to be sorted, which may add overhead for maintaining the sorted order.

In summary, use linear search for small or unsorted datasets and binary search for large, sorted datasets to achieve efficient search operations.
